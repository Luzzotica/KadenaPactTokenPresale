# Overview

This repo holds all of the files for the Kadena Token Presale course built by Luzzotica (Sterling Long).

The `starting` folder has all of the files you download throughout the course.

The `pact-examples` folder has the pact/repl files that I build as examples during the course.

The `completed` folder has completed project: All of the smart contracts, and their tests, along with the website that integrates with them.
